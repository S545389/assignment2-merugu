###### Venice

It is bulit on more than **100 small islands** in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea. Venice is known for its **bridges**. There are 417 bridges in Venice, and 72 of those are private. Houses in Venice are numbered according to districts, not streets, making is difficult to find addresses, even for postmen. The rule of thumb is to look for a monument, shop, or landmark in close proximity. There are about 350 gondolas and 400 gondalieri in Venice. On average, gondolas are 11 meters long and weigh around 600 kils. In 1608, the Council of Ten approved wearing maks only during the carnival. Those who broke the law were heavily punished. Punishments ranged from two years in prison to public beating and binding to the pillar of shame. There are 177 canals in Venice. The S-shaped Grand Canal is the biggest and splits the city in two. It has **no roads**, just canals. With its **winding canals**, **striking architecture**, and **beautiful bridges**, Venice is a popular destination for travel.
